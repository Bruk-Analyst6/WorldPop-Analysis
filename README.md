### Project Overview
---
The World Population Analysis is an open-source project that provides an insightful visualisation and analysis of global population trends. This project leverages Python and Jupyter Notebook for data processing, visualisation and transformation. Feedback and contributions are Welcomed.

### Data Source
World Population Data: The primary dataset used for this project is the "world_pop.CSV" file. Contains detailed information about the world Population until the year **2020**.

### Tools 
- Python: The programming language
  - [Download Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Jupyter Notebook: creating interactive analysis from cleaning to making a report
  - [Download Here](https://jupyter.org/)

 ### Data cleaning/preparation
 In the initial data preparation phase, We performed the following tasks:
 1. Loading the CSV file to Jupyter Notebook by importing **Pandas and NumPy libraries**.
 2. Handling missing values
 3. Datta cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Analysis(EDA)
EDA involved exploring the World Population data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall world population in the year 2020?
- Which countries are the most populous in the world by the year 2020?
  - **NOTE:** At these stages, all codes were performed by importing **matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries**.
- How is the Population growth over time?

### Correlation Analysis
These insights help understand different countries' demographic and population dynamics over time.


### Results





### Findings






### Recommendation





### Limitation
- The data only shows the World Population until the year 2020, therefore it's hard to tell the current World Population data
